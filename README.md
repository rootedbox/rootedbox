# Howdy! ðŸ¤  I'm rootedbox!

Well, howdy there partner! Allow me to introduce myself! I'm a proud Texan who has since migrated to the Golden State - San Francisco, to be exact! I got my start in the programming world on the trusty ol' Apple II with Basic, and from there, I kicked things up a notch with C on the Amiga. I dabbled in all sorts of other languages too - Pascal, ASM, and C/C++ on DOS and Linux.

Nowadays, I like to think I've moseyed on over to the more stylish side of programming. That's right, I'm talking about Ruby and Ruby on Rails, y'all! I've been tinkering around with those gems for the past 15 years, and I gotta say, they sure know how to treat a programmer right. But of course, no programming stack is complete without a little bit of JavaScript. That's where Node.js and React come in handy - I use them for all sorts of fun "glue work" to make everything run like a well-oiled machine.

So there you have it, folks! That's me, a true-blue cowboy coder, rustling up some digital magic in the wild west of technology!

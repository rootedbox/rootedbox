# Howdy! I'm rootedbox!

Howdy! I'm originally from Texas 🤠 but have been living in San Francisco 🌉 for the past 15 years. I started programming on an Apple II 🍏 using Basic and then moved on to programming in C on the Amiga. Over time, I've worked with various languages including Pascal, ASM, and C/C++ on all sorts of platforms.

Currently, I'm focused on Ruby 💎 and Ruby on Rails 🛤️, which I've been using for the past 15 years. Additionally, I use JavaScript, particularly Node.js 🟢 and React ⚛️, for integrating different parts of my projects and ensuring they run smoothly.

That's a bit about a little about me. 👋😄

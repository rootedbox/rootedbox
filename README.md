Howdy! 🤠 I’m Jason — born in Arkansas 🌳, raised in Texas 🌵, and now a long-time San Francisco transplant 🌉 with a soft spot for ☕ strong coffee, 💻 clean code, and 🎯 clever architecture. My coding story started on an Apple II 🍏, where BASIC was my gateway drug 💊. From there, I hopped to C on the Amiga 🖥️, then roamed through Pascal 📜, Assembly ⚙️, and C/C++ 🔧 like a cowboy riding across new frontiers 🐎.
Fifteen years ago, I saddled up with Ruby 💎 and Ruby on Rails 🛤️, and we’ve been building together ever since 🤝. On the JavaScript side, I’m fluent in Node.js 🟢 and React ⚛️, but my true front-end crush 💘 is Ember 🐹🔥. I don’t just use Ember—I ❤️ it. Its conventions 📏, structure 🗂️, and developer experience 🪄 feel like the framework equivalent of a well-played guitar 🎸: smooth 🎶, reliable ✅, and ready to riff 🤘.

I believe software should be as enjoyable 😄 to work on as it is to use 🙌. That means thoughtfully designed systems 🧩, maintainable code 🛠️, and the occasional 💡 “what if we tried this?” spark of creativity. Whether it’s wrangling a gnarly backend 🐍, orchestrating a frontend symphony 🎼, or gluing it all together into a seamless product 🚀, I’m in my happy place 🌈.

# Howdy! ðŸ¤  I'm rootedbox!

A little about me! I live in San Francisco, a bustling tech hub, and I grew up in Texas. My programming journey began with BASIC on the Apple II, and then I moved on to C on the Amiga. From there, I dabbled in Pascal, ASM, and C/C++ on x86 DOS/Linux.

The first part of my career was focused on C/C++ and Pascal/Delphi, honing my skills in these languages. However, in the past 15 years or so, I've primarily been working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, leveraging the power of these dynamic languages to build robust web applications. I've also spent a significant amount of time working with JavaScript, both on the server-side with Node.js and on the front-end for web development. Throughout my career, I've been involved in a lot of "glue work," integrating different technologies and systems to create seamless solutions for various projects. I'm passionate about keeping up with the latest developments in the tech industry and continuously learning and growing as a programmer.

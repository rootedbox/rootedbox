# Howdy! ðŸ¤  I'm rootedbox!

A little about me! I currently reside in San Francisco, California, but I spent my formative years in Texas. My programming journey began with Basic on the Apple II, followed by C on the Amiga. I then dabbled in Pascal, ASM, and C/C++ on x86 DOS/Linux platforms.

During the initial phase of my career, I predominantly worked with C/C++ and Pascal/Delphi. However, over the past 15 years, I have transitioned to primarily working with Ruby and Ruby on Rails, with a significant amount of JavaScript (both Node.js and web) for glue work.

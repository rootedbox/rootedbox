# Howdy! ü§† I'm rootedbox!

A little about me! I live in San Francisco.. and I grew up in Texas. Started my programing life with basic on the üçé2 then C on the Amiga.. after that Pascal, ASM, and C/C++ on x86 dos/linux. 

The first part of my career was C/C++ and Pascal/Delphi, and the past 15 or so years i've been largly working with Ruby / Ruby on Rails with a lot of glue work in javascript(node and web).
